# Group 6: Your Own Talking &amp; Loving Teddy Bear

Imagine entering your home and your Teddy Bear greeting you with a welcoming message or with lighting up eyes. Also,
it will be great if the Teddy Bear is not so welcoming to other members in the house (just for fun!). For this, you are
encouraged to use an RFID tag and reader with a choice of tags, one of them being your own, hence the Teddy realising
it is you and delivering a friendly message! You need to use at least one other tag that is not yours and hence delivering
unwelcoming messaged and red eyes! Remember, you do not need to use a real Teddy Bear but you can use other prototyping
options.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

For this Arduino project you will need to instal the following libraries:

Adafruit DRV2605
RFID-Master

To install these libraries copy and paste the folders into the following folders Arduino/libraries/
then re-start the Arduino editor.



### Installing

For your development environment you will need an Arduino code editor, we suggest the official Arduino IDE from www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software.

## Deployment

Please follow and build the included diagram using the below components. Once this is completed you will need to download the repository and install all the required libraries included in the Prerequisites section above. Open the masterTed-master file and upload to your Arduino.

The included code is fully commented to help you change and add functionality.


Enjoy your time with masterTed.

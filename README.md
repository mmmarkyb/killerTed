# Group 6: Your Own Talking &amp; Loving Teddy Bear

Imagine entering your home and your Teddy Bear greeting you with a welcoming message or with lighting up eyes. Also,
it will be great if the Teddy Bear is not so welcoming to other members in the house (just for fun!). For this, you are
encouraged to use an RFID tag and reader with a choice of tags, one of them being your own, hence the Teddy realising
it is you and delivering a friendly message! You need to use at least one other tag that is not yours and hence delivering
unwelcoming messaged and red eyes! Remember, you do not need to use a real Teddy Bear but you can use other prototyping
options.
